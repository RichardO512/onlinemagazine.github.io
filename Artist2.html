                <h3>Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
                <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890)</p>
                <p>was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history.</p>
                 <p>In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.</p>
                  <p>They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, 
                  <p>impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. </p>
                  <p>Not commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age thirty-seven.</p>
