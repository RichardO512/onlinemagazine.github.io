                <h3>Pablo Piccaso</h3>
                <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker,
                 ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France.</p>
                 <p>Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement,
                the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.</p>
                Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic
                 portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
                <p>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years,
                <p>painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence.</p>
                 During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas.
                After 1906,</p>
                <p>the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles,
                 beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.</p>
