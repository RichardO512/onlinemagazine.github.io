                <h3>Leonardo Da Vinci</h3>
                    <p>Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519)
                     an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter,
                      draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.</p>
                       <p>While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter,
                      he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects,
                       including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology.</p>
                       <p>Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal,
                         and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched 
                    only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.</p>
                    <p>Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class
                     woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the 
                     Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio.</p>
                     <p>He began
                      his career in the city, but then spent much time in the 
                      service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in 
                      Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, 
                      all while attracting a large following of imitators and students.</p>
                       <p>Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, 
                       where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements,
                        diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration,
                     making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.</p>
